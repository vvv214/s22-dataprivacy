# Data Privacy (Spring 2022)

How can we learn from data collected from individuals while ensuring their privacy? The course explores this question, starting from privacy attacks to rigorous state-of-the-art solutions using differential privacy. The class will talk about both theoretical foundations and practical issues in real-world applications. **Prerequisites** include basic knowledge of coding (e.g., Python) and be comfortable reading and writing proofs involving algorithms and probability.


- Instructor: Tianhao Wang
- Location: Rice 021
- Time: Monday and Wednesday 2:00PM - 3:15PM
- Office Hour: Monday and Wednesday 3:15PM - 4:00PM and by appointment
- TA: TBA
- Discussion: [Piazza](piazza.com/virginia/spring2022/cs6501)

## Format:
- There are no exams.
- Each lecture will involve reading one or more papers. Students will also be required to present at least one reading during the semester.
- Students will be evaluated based on class performance and a research project that they complete individually or in groups of size 2. Projects can focus on developing new theory/algorithms, or on implementing/adapting known algorithms to a real application setting. Details on projects are forthcoming.

## Tentative Syllabus:




Grading: 
- Paper presentation (20%): During the semester, each student will present a paper for 35 minutes (30min presentation plus 5min q&a).  If the slides are public or there are videos available online, it is okay to reuse the slides, but make sure you make a high-quality presentation.  Click [here]() to register.
- Paper review (4 * 5% = 20%): Each student is required to write four paper reviews for papers presented in the course.  Click [here]() to register.  Submit your paper reviews at: https://uva-privacycourse22.hotcrp.com/.
- Participation (10%): Students are expected to ask/answer questions during the presentation.
- Project (solo or a group of 2: 50%): Click [here]() to register your team with a tentative title.  The final project report should target a top-tier venue and will be graded based on intelectual merit.  Each team is required to submit a mid-term progress report and a final report, but the mid-term progress report is only used for keep tracking of progress and get feedbacks.  Submit both at: https://uva-privacycourse22-project.hotcrp.com/.  If desired, teams can utilize office hours to get feedbacks on the project.  

Tentative schedule, subject to change.
- Introduction to privacy attacks and defenses (2 lectures)
- Differential privacy (DP) and Basic building blocks (3 lectures)
- Machine learning privacy (2 lectures)
