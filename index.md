# Data Privacy (Spring 2022)

How can we learn from data collected from individuals while ensuring their privacy? The course explores this question, starting from privacy attacks to rigorous state-of-the-art solutions using differential privacy. The class will talk about both theoretical foundations and practical issues in real-world applications. **Prerequisites** include basic knowledge of coding (e.g., Python) and be comfortable reading and writing proofs involving algorithms and probability.
